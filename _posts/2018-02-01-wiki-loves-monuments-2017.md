[Wiki Loves Monuments][1] is an international photo contest organized by Wikimedia. It features photos of heritage sites around the world, from Italy to India and Germany to Thailand.

For last year's contest, a staggering 245,000 images were submitted by over 10,000 photographers. In the end, this vast pool of submissions was whittled down to only [15 winners][2].

All of the winning photos are beautiful, but I want to highlight a few that really stood out to me.

![A photograph of Wat Benchamabophit, a Buddhist temple in Bankok, Thailand.][3]

**Wat Benchamabophit by BerryJ.** This photograph features [Wat Benchamabophit][4], a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, Thailand. I love how the symmetry of the temple contrasts with the distinctly asymmetrical background of the sky.

![Svaneti towers in Mestia, Georgia.][5]

**Svaneti towers by Dmytro B.** In this photograph, Dmytro Balkhovitin captures the defensive towers typical of the [Svaneti][6] region in Georgia. The way the artificial light pierces this medieval scene in particularly attractive.

![Notre Dame basilica in Montreal, Canada.][7]

**Notre Dame basilica by Diego Delso.** This stunning photograph features the [Notre Dame basilica][8] in Montreal, Canada. It perfectly captures the church's colorful vaults and intricate statues.

![Verrucole Castle, a medieval fortress in the Italian Tuscany.][9]

**Verrucole Castle by Iris Gonelli.** I can't get enough of this photo of [Verrucole Castle][10]. The natural scenery and unusual lighting make for a beautiful composition.
